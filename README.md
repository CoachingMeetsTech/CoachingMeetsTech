- 👋 Hi, I’m @CoachingMeetsTech and I am a professional Business Coach. I have also studied Industrial Engineering and emmersed myself into the field of Conversational (Coaching) Design in a Coaching Chatbot Startup in Germany. In my last position I worked as a product owner and also prompt engineer. We created an AI powered Coaching Chatbot :D
  
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things but have decided to prioritize my programming skills (not a lot to talk about October '23) and get to work!
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Harvard CS50, Python for Beginners on Skillshare and everything I get my hands on.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solutions where Coaching/ HR meets Tech. So much will be possible in the future - let's use it to make this world a bit better.
